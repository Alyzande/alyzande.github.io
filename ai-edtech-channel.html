  <h2>Rationale &amp; Purpose</h2>
  <p>This project originated from observing that many apprentices struggled to engage with abstract academic standards but thrived when discovering concepts independently. 
  By embedding AI-generated resources strategically within coaching workflows, Alyzande applied principles of <strong>behavioural design</strong>, <strong>constructivist learning</strong>, and <strong>self-determination theory</strong> to guide learners toward autonomous mastery. 
  The system subtly used <strong>implicit scaffolding</strong> and <strong>guided discovery</strong>, shaping cognitive pathways so that learners internalised complex concepts without overt instruction.</p>

  <p>The solution demonstrates <strong>applied systems thinking</strong> and <strong>adaptive problem solving</strong>, using iterative feedback loops to influence learner behaviour through data-driven insight. 
  This reflects a mindset of <strong>strategic reasoning</strong> and <strong>situational analysis</strong> that parallels intelligence methodology: identify a knowledge gap, design a covert intervention, and observe positive behavioural change without alerting the target to the mechanism.</p>

  <p>This model showcases how <strong>AI can amplify empathy, autonomy, and inclusion</strong> in human learning while preserving agency and trust. 
  It also illustrates Alyzande’s broader capability to integrate <strong>technical systems, psychological insight, and ethical control</strong> — skills applicable to both digital education and analytical intelligence contexts. 
  The project remains private while undergoing further research and refinement.</p>

  <h2>Key Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>AI-generated theoretical, practical, and portfolio-level guidance for each KSB (Knowledge, Skills, and Behaviours) criterion.</li>
    <li>Automated generation of PowerPoint slides and Narakeet text-to-speech video content for self-paced learning.</li>
    <li>Data-driven reinforcement cycles that adapt to learner engagement patterns.</li>
    <li>Applied <strong>motivational psychology</strong> and <strong>constructivist pedagogy</strong> to foster genuine self-directed learning, using subtle reinforcement patterns to enhance engagement and retention.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Technical Details</h2>
  <p>Developed using Python scripts and generative AI models to convert apprenticeship KSB data into structured teaching materials. 
  Integrated Narakeet API for voiceover synthesis and Canva for visual presentation design. 
  Each KSB concept was transformed into three outputs: text, slides, and narrated video — forming a complete autonomous micro-learning system.</p>
